# Stacks Governance Update #1 - 24 February, 2020

## Intro

The Stacks Governance initiative was launched earlier this month. This is the first of a series of regular updates on the initiative.

The initiative was announced in [this post](https://forum.blockstack.org/t/stacks-foundation-developing-governance-for-blockstack/10335) on the community forum by Brittany on February 7. You can refer to that post for further details. In brief, the goal of this initiative is to further the process of developing and decentralizing the governance of the Stacks blockchain and ecosystem as the launch of [Stacks 2.0](https://blog.blockstack.org/announcing-the-blockstack-whitepaper-2-0/) approaches. Blockstack PBC, which up to now has acted as sole steward of R&D, and of support more generally, for the entire Blockstack ecosystem, [committed](https://blog.blockstack.org/a-path-to-decentralization/) in 2018 to further decentralization of the Blockstack network and protocol. Realizing this goal will require the community to take a more active role in governance. It will also entail establishing a new, independent entity, a Stacks Foundation.

My name is Lane Rettig, and I’m an independent researcher working with PBC on governance and acting as a liaison between PBC and the community. I’ll be active on many community channels, including Discord (especially the #governance working group channel), Discourse, and writing and sharing these updates.

I’m extremely excited about this opportunity to get to know the entire Blockstack community, to share governance best practices that have worked well in other blockchain communities (as well as ways to avoid pitfalls that have affected other communities), and to iterate to discover the very best governance mechanisms for this unique ecosystem. The Stacks blockchain, and the entire Blockstack ecosystem, is uniquely positioned and has a unique, exciting opportunity to put into place a robust, mature decentralized governance system.

As my role is primarily to steward this process and to collect and interpret community sentiment, you should think of me as being at your service. Please do not hesitate to reach out at any time to ask questions or propose ideas. See the “Get Involved” section at the end of this update for information on how best to do that!


## These Updates

I will post these updates regularly to share the latest progress of the governance project with the community. They’ll include progress since the previous update, including links to resources, as well as information on what’s planned for the coming week. Think of them as a “project standup.” These updates are written and published at [https://github.com/stacksgov/updates](https://github.com/stacksgov/updates). You may contribute to the next update by opening an issue or pull request in that repository, and you may “Watch” the repository to see all updates.


## Community Calls

We’ll also be hosting regular community calls to update the community about the progress of the project, and to give everyone a chance to have their voice heard. The first call, where Brittany, Jenny, and Lane introduced the project and its goals, happened on Feb. 13. You can find a video recording and the slide deck from the call at [https://github.com/stacksgov/resources/tree/master/calls](https://github.com/stacksgov/resources/tree/master/calls). The next call is proposed for this Thursday, Feb. 27 [UPDATE]. You can see and contribute to the [draft agenda](https://github.com/stacksgov/pm/issues/3) for the call.


## Listening Campaign

In the early stages of this governance initiative, one of the most important things to do is to listen. The goal of a listening campaign is to understand the thoughts, feelings, hopes, and fears of community members, to learn what the community feels about the mission and values of the Blockstack and Stacks blockchain projects, about what’s working well now, and about what could be done differently in the future. This will involve multiple steps, including a governance survey to be shared as broadly as possible throughout the community, and one-on-one interviews with core project stakeholders.


### Community Survey

In an effort to better understand the broader Blockstack community, and the view of community members towards governance, we’re planning to conduct a governance survey, inspired by a similar survey conducted in the Ethereum community last year. Learn more about the survey, and how to contribute to it, in [this forum post](https://forum.blockstack.org/t/community-governance-survey/10387).


### Stakeholder Interviews

This week, I began the process of interviewing core stakeholders, both at Blockstack PBC and throughout the community. These interviews are open-ended and aimed at fact-finding: hearing the perspective of core stakeholders on what is and is not working well today, and about how the project can and should be governed in the future. I will share the notes from these interviews, including a summary of overall findings and community sentiment. If you would like to nominate someone to be interviewed, you may submit the nomination here [LINK to Google form].


## Resources

A number of governance-related channels and resources have appeared over the past few days. Please check them out, if you haven’t already!

*   #governance working group channel on [Blockstack Discord](https://discordapp.com/invite/mBWc4CJ).
*   [governance category](https://forum.blockstack.org/c/governance) on Blockstack Community Forum.
*   Independent [stacksgov organization](https://github.com/stacksgov) on Github, which includes a set of [resources](https://github.com/stacksgov/resources) (including regular working group [calls](https://github.com/stacksgov/resources/tree/master/calls)), a [project management board](https://github.com/stacksgov/pm/projects/1), and these regular [updates](https://github.com/stacksgov/weekly). All of these are open for public contribution via issues and pull requests.


## Get involved

Stacks governance is a community-run initiative! As such, it cannot work without your help, and without the input of as many community members as possible. _You do not need anyone’s permission to get involved and contribute to the initiative._ The #governance working group channel on [Blockstack Discord](https://discordapp.com/invite/mBWc4CJ) is a great place to begin getting involved, as I and many other community members regularly share ideas, updates, and resources there. You can also find a number of topics under the [governance category](https://forum.blockstack.org/c/governance) on the Blockstack Community Forum which need your input.
